# Customer-Support-Ticket-System

## Description
This project implements a **Customer Support Ticket System** using **Linked List**, **Stack**, **Priority Queue**, **Circular Queue**, and **Polynomial Linked List** in Python. It helps manage customer tickets dynamically, supports undo operations, processes urgent tickets, and handles round-robin service flow.

## Features
1. **Linked List:** Add, delete, and retrieve ticket records dynamically  
2. **Stack:** Undo recent ticket operations  
3. **Priority Queue:** Process urgent tickets first  
4. **Circular Queue:** Round-robin ticket handling  
5. **Polynomial Linked List:** Compare billing histories  

## Data Structures Used
| Data Structure | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| Linked List | Store customer tickets dynamically |
| Stack | Undo last ticket addition |
| Priority Queue | Manage urgent tickets |
| Circular Queue | Round-robin ticket processing |
| Polynomial Linked List | Billing comparison |

## Learning Outcomes
- Applied Linked List, Stack, and Queue in a practical ticketing system
- Understood priority-based and round-robin operations
- Implemented polynomial comparison for billing records
